# Paycheck Sanity Checker  
**Single Source of Truth (Forge Build – v1.1 with Emotional Quiz Funnel)**

---

## 0. Prime Directive
Answer one question fast:

**“Does my paycheck look normal or suspicious?”**

This product exists to:
- surface doubt
- legitimize suspicion
- justify action

It does **not** provide legal, tax, or payroll advice.

---

## 1. Strategic Update (Why the Quiz Exists)

Adding a short quiz **strengthens Forge signal**, not weakens it.

### Purpose of the quiz
- Pre-frame suspicion
- Increase emotional commitment
- Segment users mentally before math
- Raise perceived value before the paywall

### Rules
- Max 5 questions
- Forced-choice only
- No typing
- No explanations
- Questions must **imply loss, uncertainty, or unfairness**

If the quiz takes longer than 45–60 seconds, it violates Forge.
